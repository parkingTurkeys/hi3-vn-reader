# HI3 VN reader

you can load the hi3 visual novels from the fanmade translations with this.

it's different from the other ones because it is:

- actively being updated
- open source
- useable on mobile
- __not trying to get the layout of the original__ 

this is because the original layout wouldn't really work too well with mobile. also, it uses plain html/css/js, which means you can load it onto an android device offline using a weird workaround.

## how to use it on android
open it as a file:// link instead of a content:// link (so like file:///storage/emulated/0/Download/index.html)
