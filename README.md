# HI3 VN reader

this is a viewer for translations of visual novels made for the game honkai impact 3rd.   
you can load the hi3 visual novels from the fanmade translations with this.  
translations from [here](https://github.com/RaytheonThunder/honkai-vns)  
images and original text are copyright of miHoYo  
  
please report any issues!  

it's different from the other ones because it is:  

- actively being updated
- open source
- useable on mobile
- __not trying to get the layout of the original__ 

this is because the original layout wouldn't really work too well with mobile and is hard to do. also, this uses plain html/css/js.

## tysms
i took a lot of inspiration from the [original](https://event.bh3.com/avgAntiEntropy/indexAntiEntropy.php) ofc, but i did all the scripting myself! (the original was useful for figuring out what elements i needed though :D)
