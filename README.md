# HI3 VN reader

this is a viewer for translations of visual novels made for the game honkai impact 3rd. 
you can load the hi3 visual novels from the fanmade translations with this.
translations from [here](https://github.com/RaytheonThunder/honkai-vns)
images and original text are copyright of miHoYo

please report any issues!

it's different from the other ones because it is:

- actively being updated
- open source
- useable on mobile
- __not trying to get the layout of the original__ 

this is because the original layout wouldn't really work too well with mobile and is hard to do. also, this uses plain html/css/js, which means you can load it onto an android device offline using a weird workaround.

## how to use it on android
open it as a file:// link instead of a content:// link (so like file:///storage/emulated/0/Download/hi3-vn-reader/index.html)

## progress
nothing. :3c

i took a lot of inspiration from the [original](https://event.bh3.com/avgAntiEntropy/indexAntiEntropy.php) ofc, but i did all the scripting myself! (the original was useful for figuring out what elements i needed though :D)
