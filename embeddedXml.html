                        <p class="article-text-h">To Î©:</p>
                        <p class="article-text">A good October to you. Time flies: this would already be my 22nd letter to you — last time I had finished telling you the story of the Lady Saint. But before I seek new stories to regale, let us first discuss what is happening around us.</p>
                        <p class="article-text">I have already heard of the terrible incident in September, and I apologise on their behalf. Well, it just so happens that there is a new laboratory: I anticipate you will be able to transfer to it soon. Whether the circumstances will be more favourable than your previous lab, that I cannot say for certain — because from what I hear, the new person in charge is a lady with a rather “earnest” personality.</p>
                        <p class="article-text">However, I must inform you from the standpoint of Schicksal: all the experiments you've been through, have been for the continued survival of a certain species on this planet, one so-called “Homo sapiens” — hence your continued and necessary suffering. The world will always treat some people unfairly, and this is something none of us can really change.</p>
                        <p class="article-text">It has already been three years since the disaster in Berlin. The city has already begun its reconstruction. The people will slowly forget the horrors of that night.</p>
                        <p class="article-text">Yet we all know that, at this present moment, a sinister power continues to grow and fester within the rift of space-time. It spared you back then, but it did not spare the others. If we are able to truly fathom the logic behind this phenomenon, then we “Homo sapiens” will be able to live up to our name, to use our sapience to conquer the natural world — then no one will ever need to spend another day living in fear or delusion, deceiving themselves and others.</p>
                        <p class="article-text">Yes, this is most unfair to you; in fact the most recent events have been particularly unjust to you. But if only for my sake, I hope you can understand and forgive everything. The fate of all humanity, in a certain sense, rests upon your shoulders.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p class="article-text-h">P.S.</p>
                        <p class="article-text"> Concerning your background before your memory loss: as far as I know, the relevant department should still be looking into this — but as you may already recognise, it has been more than three years since the incident, and the possibility of getting any results will only become slimmer with time. But I don't believe that so-called “Child of Honkai” Theory. You can't be a Herrscher, right?</p>
                        <p class="article-text">Perhaps the arrival of new technology will bring about some unexpected turnaround of the whole situation … who knows? The new laboratory really isn't that bad; in fact, I believe when you get there you'll be quite willing to cooperate with them — trust me.</p>

                        <p class="article-text">“Ulysses” is a novel written by Irish modernist writer James Joyce in 1922.</p>
                        <p class="article-text">The novel chronicles the daily life of the protagonist — a distressed Dubliner, a salesman by the name of Leopold Bloom — in Dublin during the day and night of June 16, 1904. </p>
                        <p class="article-text">“Ulysses” is a masterpiece of the stream-of-consciousness genre, and is hailed as one of the top 100 English novels of the 20th century. Each year, June 16 is commemorated as “Bloom Day”.</p>

                    <text>Awakened by that crazed laughter, Welt sits weak and limp in his seat, his mouth wide open and gasping for air, the blue veins of both temples twitching and pulsating.</text>
                    <text>That nightmare just now, it felt much too real — so real that Welt begins to wonder if it was a flashback from his true memory.</text>
                    <text>“Herrscher”.</text>
                    <text>Welt had heard this term before while he was in the previous labs.</text>
                    <text>According to conclusions drawn from ancient manuscripts, when the instantaneous power output of a Honkai eruption reaches over 1000HW, there is a chance for an existence called a “Herrscher” to be born within the disaster zone.</text>
                    <text>The “Herrscher” is a monster transformed from a human who is highly adaptable to Honkai Energy — </text>
                    <text> — These women can use the supernatural power originating from the “Core of the Herrscher” to destroy the human world with impunity.</text>
                    <text>Yes, “women”. More than a dozen Herrschers had been recorded in ancient literature, and with no exceptions, all of them were female.</text>
                    <text>Generally speaking, the adaptability of males to Honkai Energy is much lower than that of females —  and the Herrscher is the ultimate manifestation of that adaptability.</text>

                    <text>There are no Herrschers in the world today. Also, those various statements referring to them in ancient literature may be nothing more than crude creation myths.</text>

                        <p class="article-text">(Translator's note: the original Chinese describes Tesla as a member of “æœˆå…‰æ—”, or “moonlight clan” — someone who spends their entire income every month. It has a different meaning from the English term “Moonlighter”. The Chinese version of this note simply explained the term using the English phrase “living from paycheck to paycheck”).</p>

                        <p class="article-text" style="color:rgb(181,233,247);">The second law of thermodynamics can be formulated as follows: if the entropy of a system decreases, it will inevitably cause the entropy of another system to rise by a greater margin. From the perspective of information theory, this is equivalent to the huge information asymmetry between the ordinary environment where information is highly chaotic, and the negative entropic environment where information is highly ordered. Historically, research has shown that Honkai energy and this information asymmetry have a strong inter-relationship. Mathematically, the imaginary internal energy belongs to the collapsing, convergent manifold, while the so-called divergent manifold — that is, the four-dimensional space-time that we can usually perceive — contains the thermodynamic manifestation of the “real internal energy”; together these can be mathematically-expressed as a higher-order complex function, and as a result it can be used to predict Honkai fluctuations at the sub-atomic scale. Therefore, current researchers generally suspect that this “imaginary internal energy” is Honkai energy, or at least a major constituent of it.</p>

Sheridan's men, in 1882, found that linen and cotton fabrics were uninjured by the action of the water, but woolen clothes were torn to shreds.” (Translator's note: taken from “The Yellowstone National Park — A Manual for Tourists” by Henry Winser, 1883 — as cited in the Old Faithful Wikipedia article.)</p>

As the microwave-emitting machine operates steadily at full load, the “protective film” of the painting slowly becomes opaque, revealing the unique silvery-white lustre of metal. Drops of liquid metal continuously seep out and vibrate on the canvas, as though they were beads of sweat, and gradually the metal begins to separate from the painting. </p>

                        <p class="article-text">Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an encryption technology that is quite common today. </p>
                        <p class="article-text">The elliptic curve here refers to an algebraic curve of the shape y^2 = x^3 + ax + b, not an ellipse in a conical curve. The elliptic curve is called an “elliptic curve” because a formula of the form x^3 + ax + b will appear in the process of integral calculation of the elliptic arc length; and it is also related to the reason why the elliptic arc length cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. Elliptic curves are also a key springboard to prove Fermat's Last Theorem — its importance in algebra is evident.</p>
                        <p class="article-text"> ECC is more difficult to crack than another common encryption technology, RSA (factorisation cipher).  For example, the minimum key length recommended by the National Bureau of Standards and Technology is 160 bits for ECC and 1024 bits for RSA. </p>

Lab 42 is now on a “quasi-holiday” because the supercomputer Ada has been shackled with a computationally-heavy task — which means Welt needs to organise recreational activities for the two doctors every day for the entire period. Although one of the doctors proclaims that “Just because we're on vacation, doesn't mean we don't need to work some days”; given the personality of the other doctor, it seems difficult to say for certain what the workload is going to be like for Welt … </p>

Sometimes, they may even lose, defeated and embarrassed by their own human foibles. Spiritually, they may be giants, but sometimes physically or materially they are weaklings; their spiritual strength often takes a long time to be passed down to later generations, before they are eventually recognised as cherished paragons. </p>

                        <p class="article-text">Foie gras (“fat liver”) is a famous French dish, often called “geese liver” in Chinese (é¹…è‚), when in fact, duck liver can also used as the raw ingredient. </p>
                        <p class="article-text">Foie gras farms force ducks or geese to develop fatty livers by tube-feeding food directly into their stomachs. Gavage is carried out for 2 to 4 weeks, 2 to 3 times a day, when a specially-prepared slurry of feed is directly poured into the oesophagus using a tube. This will cause a large amount of excess nutrients to accumulate in its liver, resulting in an enlarged and delicate fatty liver. </p>

                        <p class="article-text">Pandu was the ancestor of the Pandavas in the Hindu epic “Mahabharata”, and the nominal father of the “five sons of Pandu”, who included Arjuna among others. </p>
                        <p class="article-text">When he was young, Pandu hunted in the countryside, and shot arrows at a mating antelope — but the antelope happened to be the incarnation of a sage, and Pandu was cursed by him to not be able to approach others with the intention of lovemaking, or else he would die tragically.   When he grew up, as a king, he married Kunti, who had learned immortality. Kunti gave birth to sons (including Karna, the son of the Sun god, who was born before her marriage. This eldest son was adopted and brought up by a charioteer), thus giving Pandu heirs. (Translator's note: This is not entirely accurate as far as the most common version of the Mahabharata is concerned — Pandu had already married before he shot the sage and became cursed; Pandu thus exiled himself and his family from his own kingdom because of this curse [hence Tesla's nickname for the cat]; Kunti never learned of immortality; and precisely because of Pandu's curse, all her sons were sired by different fathers, who were all Hindu Gods.) </p>

What did she experience?  When Ada eventually decodes her encrypted information, how should we face it? Einstein and Tesla believed that “there can be no decision without proper investigation and research” — but the external situation may change rapidly at any moment, in a myriad ways — can that really give them enough time? </p>

                        <p class="article-text">The Maunsell Forts are a series of a mass-produced air defense towers built by the British at the mouth of the Rivers Thames and Mersey during World War II.</p>
                        <p class="article-text">The structure of a marine fort is similar to that of an anti-aircraft battery on land. The difference is that it is built on tall stilts atop a concrete barge. After the fort is assembled in the dock, it is towed by a tug to the designated area in the sea, then the concrete barge is scuttled, firmly anchoring the fort's foundation to the seafloor. </p>
                        <p class="article-text">After World War II, the forts were abandoned. Among them, “HM Fort Roughs”, located on the open sea east of the County of Suffolk, was occupied by the family of army veteran Paddy Roy Bates on September 2, 1967. Furthermore, they proclaimed “independence” under international law as the “Principality of Sealand”. Although this declaration is considered by the international community to have no legitimacy, it has become an amusing case in the application of international law. (Translator's note: HM Fort Roughs was misspelled as HMS Fort Rough in the Chinese text. The Fort is not a ship so HMS is the wrong prefix.) </p>

This famine, caused by the failure of potato harvests and the inaction of the British government, caused the population of the island of Ireland to drop by half. Since most of the Irish immigrants left or died in the disaster are poor people whose native language is Gaelic, the local language in Ireland has gradually changed to English, which has permanently changed the language and cultural ecology of the island.</p>

                        <p class="article-text">The Boston Massacre was a clash between British soldiers and the people of Boston, resulting in the death of five people.</p>
                        <p class="article-text">On March 5, 1770, a British officer (John Goldfinch) bought a wig and returned to camp. The clerk of the wig shop (Edward Garrick) misunderstood and though that the officer did not pay, so he shouted and misbehaved with the officer. The officer had actually setteled the acount and ignored the insults. However a private in his entourage (Hugh White) started an quarrel with the clerk, and finally beat him. The hurt clerk was bleeding and started weeping, and the angry onlookers immediately surrounded the officer and his men. Another British army officer (Thomas Preston) led several soldiers to rescue them, but they were thrown stones and beaten by the people. The British army fired at the crowd in a hurry, killing 5 civilians and causing other six people to be injured.</p>
                        <p class="article-text">Although the responsibility for this matter was not entirely on the British army, it greatly intensified the previous tensions existing between the military and civilians in the British North American colonies, and eventually became one of the most significant events leading to the outbreak of the American Revolution.</p>

We should not be partial to its meaning; in fact, in the same chapter, Clausewitz wrote: “If civilized nations do not kill captives or destroy cities and villages, this does not mean that they did not resort to violence. It is because they have used wisdom more and more skillfully in war, and learned to use violence methods that are more effective than this primitive and crude venting instinct.”</p>

                        <p class="article-text">This is German, the native language of Overseer Otto. "Heilige Lanze" means "Holy Gun" and "Welwitschie" means "Centenarian Orchid".</p>
                        <p class="article-text">p.s. Welwitschia is the only species of "Welwitschia family" and "Welwitschia". Also known as "Wonderful World". In 1859, it was discovered in the desert of Angola by the Austrian explorer Friedrich Welwitsch. Dioecious. The stem is short and only grows two leaves in a lifetime (opposite, the two leaves will grow indefinitely; the distal end will gradually dry up into strips and gather into piles, making it impossible to see that they are originally two leaves). The roots are extremely long, up to 3 meters to 10 meters, to absorb groundwater. The average life span can reach hundreds of years, and some individuals can even reach more than two thousand years. It is the national flower of Namibia, neighboring Angola.</p>

                        <p class="article-text">This is the history of the real world.</p>
                        <p class="article-text">In late 1875, Thomas Edison (1847 ~ 1931) moved his home to "Monroe Park" in Raritan Town. Here, from the opening of the laboratory in 1876 to the move out of the factory in 1887, Edison developed more than 400 inventions and applied for more than 1,000 patents in 11 years.</p>
                        <p class="article-text">In 1925, the state of New Jersey honored Edison by erecting the "Thomas Edison Memorial" at the Site of Monroe Park, where Edison's home and laboratory had collapsed due to disuse.</p>
                        <p class="article-text">In 1954, the town of Raritan was renamed "Edison City" to further honor Edison.</p>
                        <p class="article-text">Today, Edison is one of the most livable towns in the world.</p>

                        <p class="article-text">But time is merciless, and the wood from which the ship was made gradually decayed. So that the great ship would not end up being burned as a sacrifice, they came up with a good idea: every few years, all the parts of the ship should be inspected, and if any were rotten, they would be replaced with new ones.</p>
                        <p class="article-text">So, many years later, when a philosopher came to visit, all the parts on the ship had been replaced at least twice.</p>
                        <p class="article-text">When the philosopher heard of this, he was very upset. He asked the local people, "Is this still the same ship?”</p>
                        <p class="article-text">The locals replied nonchalantly: "If you say no, Mr. Philosopher, when do you think it started not to be? You have to know that even when going out to sea, ships need to replace parts from time to time.”</p>

                    <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">As someone from Brooklyn... I am proud of what we've accomplished. We managed to rebuild that building.</speak>

                    <speak chara="newsNoFace">In those chaotic and perilous twilit hours, people like John Smith inspected every corner of the building to eliminate any potential hazards.</speak>
                    <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">We just followed procedures, really. In situations like that, it's impossible for your brain to figure out what to do, so the only thing we could do was to follow existing disaster management procedures.</speak>
                    <speak chara="johnSmithNoFace">But I gotta give thanks to everyone who was in the building, they respected our instructions and evacuated the building without panicking.</speak>
