        <p class="article-text-h">To Î©:</p>
        <p class="article-text">A good October to you. Time flies: this would already be my 22nd letter to you â€” last time I had finished telling you the story of the Lady Saint. But before I seek new stories to regale, let us first discuss what is happening around us.</p>
        <p class="article-text">I have already heard of the terrible incident in September, and I apologise on their behalf. Well, it just so happens that there is a new laboratory: I anticipate you will be able to transfer to it soon. Whether the circumstances will be more favourable than your previous lab, that I cannot say for certain â€” because from what I hear, the new person in charge is a lady with a rather â€œearnestâ€ personality.</p>
        <p class="article-text">However, I must inform you from the standpoint of Schicksal: all the experiments you've been through, have been for the continued survival of a certain species on this planet, one so-called â€œHomo sapiensâ€ â€” hence your continued and necessary suffering. The world will always treat some people unfairly, and this is something none of us can really change.</p>
        <p class="article-text">It has already been three years since the disaster in Berlin. The city has already begun its reconstruction. The people will slowly forget the horrors of that night.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Yet we all know that, at this present moment, a sinister power continues to grow and fester within the rift of space-time. It spared you back then, but it did not spare the others. If we are able to truly fathom the logic behind this phenomenon, then we â€œHomo sapiensâ€ will be able to live up to our name, to use our sapience to conquer the natural world â€” then no one will ever need to spend another day living in fear or delusion, deceiving themselves and others.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Yes, this is most unfair to you; in fact the most recent events have been particularly unjust to you. But if only for my sake, I hope you can understand and forgive everything. The fate of all humanity, in a certain sense, rests upon your shoulders.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="article-text-h">P.S.</p>
        <p class="article-text"> Concerning your background before your memory loss: as far as I know, the relevant department should still be looking into this â€” but as you may already recognise, it has been more than three years since the incident, and the possibility of getting any results will only become slimmer with time. But I don't believe that so-called â€œChild of Honkaiâ€ Theory. You can't be a Herrscher, right?</p>
        <p class="article-text">Perhaps the arrival of new technology will bring about some unexpected turnaround of the whole situation â€¦ who knows? The new laboratory really isn't that bad; in fact, I believe when you get there you'll be quite willing to cooperate with them â€” trust me.</p>

        <p class="article-text-h">Note:</p>
        <p class="article-text">The Imperial Institute is located in Kensington, London. It was founded by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom in 1888 and became one of the founding members of Imperial College, London in 1907. (Translator's note: This is not accurate: the Imperial Institute remained a separate institution from Imperial College, although the College now occupies the spot where the Institute once stood.)</p>
        <p class="article-text">In 1958, the Imperial Institute was renamed the Commonwealth Institute and the campus was rebuilt elsewhere. Of the original building, only the iconic Queen's Tower was retained.</p>
    </remark>
    <text>Having been â€œdriven out of the houseâ€ by that violent redhaired girl, the pitiful young man now wanders aimlessly around the college, a college with close to 70 years of history.</text>

    <text>He can't fathom why, but even though she is also a member of Schicksal, the feeling of being so cruelly treated by this girl â€”</text>
    <text>â€” It doesn't seem that unpleasant to him.</text>
    <speak chara="weltNoFace">Phew â€¦ Even now I'm having such mixed-up thoughts.</speak>
    <bgm src="serenity.mp3" status="start"></bgm>
    <text article="1">
        <p class="article-text">The Imperial Institute.</p>
        <p class="article-text">In this institution, there are not only low-rise detached buildings like Lab 42, but also several, tall towering buildings with mottled peeling walls.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Close by, the pastel-green dome of the Queen's Tower is covered with dust and rainwater trails, producing an inexpressibly ugly colour and lustre â€” it is as if, even on such an uncommonly clear day, it felt the need to mock and remind people of the irksome air pollution that occurs every other weekday.</p>
    </text>
    <text>Having been accustomed to the spotless environs of high-end research labs, the young man named Welt feels oddly comforted by what could be considered as the landmark equivalent of a washed-up celebrity.</text>
    <text>Although there is no personal freedom in the absolute sense â€” at least this â€œomnipresent and omnipotentâ€ organisation has chosen to loosen up for a moment.</text>
    <text>Well, maybe.</text>
    <text>Autumn is slowly setting in, and the sun makes a futile attempt to imbue some warmth into the cooling windswept earth.</text>
    <text>Leaning on a marble railing beside a footpath, Welt vigorously pats his cheeks.</text>
    <text>Better think up something more positive.</text>
    <sound src="deep breath.mp3"/>
    <text>Take a deep breath â€”</text>
    <text>â€¦</text>
    <text>â€” Look at how beautiful the world is.</text>
    <text article="1">
        <p class="article-text">To the north of the institute is a large expanse of lush and verdant woodland. They say it's the famous Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens â€” but that will probably be of no interest to that particular pair of lady geniuses.</p>
        <p class="article-text">For those elites in their ivory tower, I fear that the only method of relaxation that comes to mind is to lean against a garden bench, close one's eyes, and relax.</p>
        <p class="article-text">It's not creative enough. Even leaving Einstein aside, Tesla will definitely be bored out of her mind.</p>
    </text>
    <text article="1">
        <p class="article-text">I should take them somewhere else more interesting.</p>
        <p class="article-text">London should have no shortage of fun things to do â€” With this thought in mind, Welt decides to go to the library to try his luck, and see if there is any information available there.</p>
        <p class="article-text">â€” Of course, he cannot know that in the future, there will be something more convenient like the Internet.</p>

    <text>The detached Lab 42 is a work villa built during the post-war period, so it sports an avant-garde design integrating both work and living requirements.</text>
    <text>The ground floor houses a study, workshop, guest room, various kitchen and bathroom facilities, and even a secret warehouse secured with a vault door;</text>
    <text>The top floor is a residential area where â€œmen are forbidden to enterâ€. Welt is not particularly clear what that area looks like. </text>
    <text>Pink curtains? Cream-coloured furniture? A room full of sweets and plush toys?</text>

        <p class="article-text">â€œUlyssesâ€ is a novel written by Irish modernist writer James Joyce in 1922.</p>
        <p class="article-text">The novel chronicles the daily life of the protagonist â€” a distressed Dubliner, a salesman by the name of Leopold Bloom â€” in Dublin during the day and night of June 16, 1904. </p>
        <p class="article-text">â€œUlyssesâ€ is a masterpiece of the stream-of-consciousness genre, and is hailed as one of the top 100 English novels of the 20th century. Each year, June 16 is commemorated as â€œBloom Dayâ€.</p>

    <text>Awakened by that crazed laughter, Welt sits weak and limp in his seat, his mouth wide open and gasping for air, the blue veins of both temples twitching and pulsating.</text>
    <text>That nightmare just now, it felt much too real â€” so real that Welt begins to wonder if it was a flashback from his true memory.</text>
    <text>â€œHerrscherâ€.</text>
    <text>Welt had heard this term before while he was in the previous labs.</text>
    <text>According to conclusions drawn from ancient manuscripts, when the instantaneous power output of a Honkai eruption reaches over 1000HW, there is a chance for an existence called a â€œHerrscherâ€ to be born within the disaster zone.</text>
    <text>The â€œHerrscherâ€ is a monster transformed from a human who is highly adaptable to Honkai Energy â€” </text>
    <text> â€” These women can use the supernatural power originating from the â€œCore of the Herrscherâ€ to destroy the human world with impunity.</text>
    <text>Yes, â€œwomenâ€. More than a dozen Herrschers had been recorded in ancient literature, and with no exceptions, all of them were female.</text>
    <text>Generally speaking, the adaptability of males to Honkai Energy is much lower than that of females â€”  and the Herrscher is the ultimate manifestation of that adaptability.</text>
    <speak chara="weltNoFace">â€¦</speak>
    <text>There are no Herrschers in the world today. Also, those various statements referring to them in ancient literature may be nothing more than crude creation myths.</text>
    <text>But one thing continues to make the young man Welt feel uneasy: in his dream, the woman whose form he had taken, why were her thoughts so chilling and frightful?</text>

        <p class="article-text" style="color:rgb(181,233,247);">The second law of thermodynamics can be formulated as follows: if the entropy of a system decreases, it will inevitably cause the entropy of another system to rise by a greater margin. From the perspective of information theory, this is equivalent to the huge information asymmetry between the ordinary environment where information is highly chaotic, and the negative entropic environment where information is highly ordered. Historically, research has shown that Honkai energy and this information asymmetry have a strong inter-relationship. Mathematically, the imaginary internal energy belongs to the collapsing, convergent manifold, while the so-called divergent manifold â€” that is, the four-dimensional space-time that we can usually perceive â€” contains the thermodynamic manifestation of the â€œreal internal energyâ€; together these can be mathematically-expressed as a higher-order complex function, and as a result it can be used to predict Honkai fluctuations at the sub-atomic scale. Therefore, current researchers generally suspect that this â€œimaginary internal energyâ€ is Honkai energy, or at least a major constituent of it.</p>

Garments placed in the crater during quiescence are ejected thoroughly washed when the eruption takes place. Gen.

Sometimes, they may even lose, defeated and embarrassed by their own human foibles. Spiritually, they may be giants, but sometimes physically or materially they are weaklings; their spiritual strength often takes a long time to be passed down to later generations, before they are eventually recognised as cherished paragons. </p>

        <p class="article-text-h">Note: </p>
        <p class="article-text">Pandu was the ancestor of the Pandavas in the Hindu epic â€œMahabharataâ€, and the nominal father of the â€œfive sons of Panduâ€, who included Arjuna among others. </p>
        <p class="article-text">When he was young, Pandu hunted in the countryside, and shot arrows at a mating antelope â€” but the antelope happened to be the incarnation of a sage, and Pandu was cursed by him to not be able to approach others with the intention of lovemaking, or else he would die tragically.   When he grew up, as a king, he married Kunti, who had learned immortality. Kunti gave birth to sons (including Karna, the son of the Sun god, who was born before her marriage. This eldest son was adopted and brought up by a charioteer), thus giving Pandu heirs. (Translator's note: This is not entirely accurate as far as the most common version of the Mahabharata is concerned â€” Pandu had already married before he shot the sage and became cursed; Pandu thus exiled himself and his family from his own kingdom because of this curse [hence Tesla's nickname for the cat]; Kunti never learned of immortality; and precisely because of Pandu's curse, all her sons were sired by different fathers, who were all Hindu Gods.) </p>

        <p class="article-text-h">Note:</p>
        <p class="article-text">The Maunsell Forts are a series of a mass-produced air defense towers built by the British at the mouth of the Rivers Thames and Mersey during World War II.</p>
        <p class="article-text">The structure of a marine fort is similar to that of an anti-aircraft battery on land. The difference is that it is built on tall stilts atop a concrete barge. After the fort is assembled in the dock, it is towed by a tug to the designated area in the sea, then the concrete barge is scuttled, firmly anchoring the fort's foundation to the seafloor. </p>
        <p class="article-text">After World War II, the forts were abandoned. Among them, â€œHM Fort Roughsâ€, located on the open sea east of the County of Suffolk, was occupied by the family of army veteran Paddy Roy Bates on September 2, 1967. Furthermore, they proclaimed â€œindependenceâ€ under international law as the â€œPrincipality of Sealandâ€. Although this declaration is considered by the international community to have no legitimacy, it has become an amusing case in the application of international law. (Translator's note: HM Fort Roughs was misspelled as HMS Fort Rough in the Chinese text. The Fort is not a ship so HMS is the wrong prefix.) </p>

It became Î± because it was originally the Polaris or North Star five thousand years ago.)

        <p class="article-text">Irish people began to migrate to the northeastern United States on a large scale, after the Great Irish Famine broke out in 1845. This famine, caused by the failure of potato harvests and the inaction of the British government, caused the population of the island of Ireland to drop by half. Since most of the Irish immigrants left or died in the disaster are poor people whose native language is Gaelic, the local language in Ireland has gradually changed to English, which has permanently changed the language and cultural ecology of the island.</p>

        <p class="article-text-h">Note:</p>
        <p class="article-text">The Boston Massacre was a clash between British soldiers and the people of Boston, resulting in the death of five people.</p>
        <p class="article-text">On March 5, 1770, a British officer (John Goldfinch) bought a wig and returned to camp. The clerk of the wig shop (Edward Garrick) misunderstood and though that the officer did not pay, so he shouted and misbehaved with the officer. The officer had actually setteled the acount and ignored the insults. However a private in his entourage (Hugh White) started an quarrel with the clerk, and finally beat him. The hurt clerk was bleeding and started weeping, and the angry onlookers immediately surrounded the officer and his men. Another British army officer (Thomas Preston) led several soldiers to rescue them, but they were thrown stones and beaten by the people. The British army fired at the crowd in a hurry, killing 5 civilians and causing other six people to be injured.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Although the responsibility for this matter was not entirely on the British army, it greatly intensified the previous tensions existing between the military and civilians in the British North American colonies, and eventually became one of the most significant events leading to the outbreak of the American Revolution.</p>

        <p class="article-text">Tyre is the god of war in Norse mythology--or rather, the god of heroes and courage. In different languages, his name is written in: TÃ½r (Old Norse), Ty (Old Norwegian), Ti (Old Swedish), Tiw or Tiu (Old English), Ziu or Zio (Old German), etc.</p>
        <p class="article-text">p.s. Tuesday (Tuesday) in English actually means "Tiw's Day" (Tiw's Day).</p>

It is because they have used wisdom more and more skillfully in war, and learned to use violence methods that are more effective than this primitive and crude venting instinct.â€</p>

The stem is short and only grows two leaves in a lifetime (opposite, the two leaves will grow indefinitely; the distal end will gradually dry up into strips and gather into piles, making it impossible to see that they are originally two leaves). The roots are extremely long, up to 3 meters to 10 meters, to absorb groundwater. The average life span can reach hundreds of years, and some individuals can even reach more than two thousand years.

        <p class="article-text">Carbolic acid, or phenol (chemical formula: PhOH), is the simplest phenolic organic substance; its dilute solution is the earliest disinfectant used in modern medicine. Phenol is an unsafe disinfectant. Its concentrated solution has a strong ability to penetrate and corrode the skin, and is highly toxic; in modern times, its main use is in chemical synthesis, such as the manufacture of aspirin and phenolic resin.</p>

It is also called "Black Sea Stray" and "Caspian Sea Stray" because of its origin. The European sturgeon is one of the largest freshwater fish species in the world, and is also the largest and most precious species of sturgeon, with a body length of more than 8 meters and a weight of more than 1 ton. The caviar of the European catfish (especially produced in Astrakhan, the "mouth of the Volga River") has plump eggs, a smooth taste, and a long-lasting aftertaste. It is the most delicious and valuable variety of all caviar.</p>

        <p class="article-text">This is the history of the real world.</p>
        <p class="article-text">In late 1875, Thomas Edison (1847 ~ 1931) moved his home to "Monroe Park" in Raritan Town. Here, from the opening of the laboratory in 1876 to the move out of the factory in 1887, Edison developed more than 400 inventions and applied for more than 1,000 patents in 11 years.</p>
        <p class="article-text">In 1925, the state of New Jersey honored Edison by erecting the "Thomas Edison Memorial" at the Site of Monroe Park, where Edison's home and laboratory had collapsed due to disuse.</p>
        <p class="article-text">In 1954, the town of Raritan was renamed "Edison City" to further honor Edison.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Today, Edison is one of the most livable towns in the world.</p>

    </remark>
    <text>According to the reports, the center of the pulse is New York city, and said pulse is very similar to a Houkai energy pulse.</text>
    <text>However, there was no time to be amazed or worried.According to the ã€ŒUrgent Inquiry Listã€, she has been assigned as the Chief Commander and must oversee all rescue operations.</text>
    <text>She was always planning to act in the shadows so all this did was to speed up the schedule. She has to do what she can to evacuate all potential people that could turn into Otto's hostages.</text>
    <text>â€”â€”To confuse a potential hidden enemy, she used a double to pretend she had just left the base station and contacted her students as if the plan had just been put in motion now.</text>
    <text>Who could have guessed two conflicting opinions would lead to her becoming the commander of the strongest country in the world, albeit temporarily.</text>
    <text>For now, all non-combatants working in the base must evacuate. The most ã€Œimportant guestsã€ should be coming here shortly.</text>
    <text>Looking at the results alone, seems she was very luckyâ€”â€” This is a very large country after all.</text>

        <p class="article-text">There was a hero of the Athenians named Theseus. He was so great that the locals consecrated the ship he sailed as a monument.</p>
        <p class="article-text">But time is merciless, and the wood from which the ship was made gradually decayed. So that the great ship would not end up being burned as a sacrifice, they came up with a good idea: every few years, all the parts of the ship should be inspected, and if any were rotten, they would be replaced with new ones.</p>
        <p class="article-text">So, many years later, when a philosopher came to visit, all the parts on the ship had been replaced at least twice.</p>
        <p class="article-text">When the philosopher heard of this, he was very upset. He asked the local people, "Is this still the same ship?â€</p>
        <p class="article-text">The locals replied nonchalantly: "If you say no, Mr. Philosopher, when do you think it started not to be? You have to know that even when going out to sea, ships need to replace parts from time to time.â€</p>
